# Security Checklist for RetroBBS Development

## Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

### Critical Security Requirements (MUST BE COMPLETED)

- [ ] **JWT Secret Configuration**
  - [ ] Generate cryptographically secure JWT_SECRET (min 64 characters)
  - [ ] Store JWT_SECRET in environment variables only
  - [ ] Remove all hardcoded secrets from code

- [ ] **Default Credentials Removal**
  - [ ] Remove hardcoded admin user creation
  - [ ] Implement secure admin setup process
  - [ ] Force admin password change on first login

- [ ] **Input Validation & SQL Injection Prevention**
  - [ ] All SQL queries use parameterized statements
  - [ ] User input validation on all endpoints
  - [ ] Content sanitization for message boards
  - [ ] File upload validation and type checking

- [ ] **Authentication & Authorization**
  - [ ] All sensitive endpoints require authentication
  - [ ] Proper session management with expiration
  - [ ] Account lockout after failed login attempts
  - [ ] Password strength requirements enforced

### High Priority Security Items

- [ ] **File Security**
  - [ ] Path traversal prevention in file downloads
  - [ ] File type validation on uploads
  - [ ] Virus scanning for uploaded files
  - [ ] File size limits enforced

- [ ] **Network Security**
  - [ ] CORS properly configured with specific origins
  - [ ] HTTPS enforced in production
  - [ ] Security headers implemented (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
  - [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints

- [ ] **Database Security**
  - [ ] Database connections secured
  - [ ] Foreign key constraints enabled
  - [ ] Regular database backups configured
  - [ ] Audit logging implemented

### Medium Priority Security Items

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] No sensitive information in error messages
  - [ ] Proper error logging without data exposure
  - [ ] Graceful failure handling

- [ ] **Monitoring & Logging**
  - [ ] Security event logging
  - [ ] Failed login attempt monitoring
  - [ ] File access logging
  - [ ] Unusual activity detection

- [ ] **Dependency Security**
  - [ ] All dependencies up to date
  - [ ] Regular security audits (`npm audit`)
  - [ ] No vulnerable packages in use

## Code Review Security Guidelines

### Authentication & Session Management
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Secure token generation
const token = jwt.sign(payload, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '24h' });

// ❌ Bad: Hardcoded secret
const token = jwt.sign(payload, 'hardcoded-secret');
```

### SQL Query Security
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Parameterized query
db.run('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId]);

// ❌ Bad: String concatenation
db.run(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`);
```

### Input Validation
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Validation and sanitization
if (!validator.isEmail(email)) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Invalid email' });
}
const sanitizedContent = validator.escape(content);

// ❌ Bad: No validation
db.run('INSERT INTO messages (content) VALUES (?)', [req.body.content]);
```

### File Upload Security
```javascript
// ✅ Good: File type validation
const allowedMimes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'text/plain'];
if (!allowedMimes.includes(file.mimetype)) {
    return cb(new Error('Invalid file type'), false);
}

// ❌ Bad: No file type checking
upload.single('file')(req, res, next);
```

## Security Testing Procedures

### Manual Security Testing

1. **Authentication Testing**
   - [ ] Test password reset functionality
   - [ ] Verify session timeout
   - [ ] Test account lockout mechanism
   - [ ] Verify JWT token validation

2. **Authorization Testing**
   - [ ] Test access to admin endpoints without admin role
   - [ ] Verify user can only access own data
   - [ ] Test privilege escalation attempts

3. **Input Validation Testing**
   - [ ] Test SQL injection in all input fields
   - [ ] Test XSS in message content
   - [ ] Test path traversal in file operations
   - [ ] Test command injection attempts

4. **File Upload Testing**
   - [ ] Test malicious file uploads
   - [ ] Test large file uploads
   - [ ] Test file type validation
   - [ ] Test path traversal in filenames

### Automated Security Testing

```bash
# Run dependency audit
npm audit

# Run security linting
npm run lint:security

# Run OWASP ZAP scan (if configured)
zap-baseline.py -t http://localhost:3000

# Run Bandit scan for Python components
bandit -r ./

# Run Semgrep for code security
semgrep --config=auto ./
```

## Incident Response Procedures

### Security Incident Response Plan

1. **Immediate Response**
   - [ ] Identify and contain the incident
   - [ ] Preserve evidence and logs
   - [ ] Assess the scope of the breach
   - [ ] Notify stakeholders if required

2. **Investigation**
   - [ ] Analyze attack vectors
   - [ ] Identify compromised data
   - [ ] Document findings
   - [ ] Determine root cause

3. **Recovery**
   - [ ] Apply security patches
   - [ ] Reset compromised credentials
   - [ ] Monitor for continued activity
   - [ ] Verify system integrity

4. **Post-Incident**
   - [ ] Update security procedures
   - [ ] Improve monitoring
   - [ ] Train team on lessons learned
   - [ ] Update incident response plan
