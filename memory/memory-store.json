Refactor frontend/terminal.js (901 lines) into:\n   - /frontend/src/terminal/ (core terminal, command processing)\n   - /frontend/src/menus/ (welcome, main, messages, files, games)\n   - /frontend/src/handlers/ (command handlers, websocket handling)\n\nPHASE 2: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS (High Priority)\n1. Database layer optimization:\n   - Convert to Promise-based queries\n   - Add connection pooling\n   - Implement prepared statements\n   - Add database indexes\n   - Create migration system\n\n2. WebSocket optimizations:\n   - Message throttling\n   - Connection cleanup\n   - Room management optimization\n   - Memory leak prevention\n\nPHASE 3: CACHING & SCALABILITY (Medium Priority)\n1. Add Redis caching layer\n2. Implement response compression\n3. Add request deduplication\n4. Optimize file handling\n5. Add monitoring and metrics\n\nESTIMATED IMPACT:\n- 60% reduction in file complexity\n- 40% improvement in response times\n- 80% reduction in memory usage\n- 100% compliance with <500 line rule",
